# Snowflake-and-Salesforce-Connect

This is a Python Class that uses both  simple_salesforce and snowflake.connector 

I built this file as a way to connect with snowflake and Veeva data sources. The goal is to use this code as a base file so that anytime a connection from either of
those two sources are needed then a user can quickly copy and paste this info in to get started.


The user will need to create a seperate config file that contains a username and password for both Snowflake and Veeva systems
